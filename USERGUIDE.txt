Hedvig Terraform Provider

This set of files forms a provider for Terraform and defines several resources that can can be managed through it. Currently, Vdisks on a Hedvig cluster can be created, and then LUNs or Mountpoints can be attached to them, and Accesses can be defined on these.

To use:

Run "terraform init" to incorporate the binary into Terraform.

Modify the enclosed file ("config.tf") to define the desired resources.

Run "terraform plan" to make sure the resources will be created properly.

Run "terraform apply" to create the resources in the configuration file.



Run "terraform destroy" to remove all resources created in this way.
